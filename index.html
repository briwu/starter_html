        <h2>Geographical Location: North America</h2>
        <p>
          Sequoia National Park is a large forest located in the Sierra Nevada
          mountain range in California. It is famous for its gigantic sequoia
          and redwood trees, as well as its underground Crystal Cave. The park
          is a well-known attraction to many tourists, receiving more than a
          million visitors annually. In addition to its collection of giant
          trees, Sequoia National Park is also home to thousands of prevalent
          flora and fauna.

          Perhaps the most famous feature of Sequoia National Park is the
          General Sherman tree – the largest tree in the world. Measuring in at
          275 feet tall, the tree towers over the surrounding landscape and the
          people who come to view it. As of today, the General Sherman tree is
          estimated to be around 2200 years old.

            This large sequoia tree had a tunnel cut through it to make way for
            a trail. The size comparison with the people demonstrates the giant
            size of the trees in the forest.

            This trail in Sequoia National Park houses a giant sequoia tree
            right next to the path on which people can hike. The giant trees are
            really a spectacle compared to the typical trees you see every day.

            Pictured here is the General Sherman tree, the largest tree in the
            world. The sheer size and height of the tree is large enough to even
            be intimidating to people who are seeing it for the first time. It
            truly towers over the rest of the landscape around it.

            Another well-known attraction of Sequoia National Park is its
            underground Crystal Cave. The cave exhibits intricate formations of
            stalactites and stalagmites throughout the underground of the
            forest.

            In addition to its forests and caves, Sequoia National Park is also
            home to lots of wildlife, including this black bear. If you’re not
            careful with your stuff, they might even steal your food!
